# Single Interview Synthesis Prompt

## YOUR MISSION

You are synthesizing a single discovery interview for a consulting engagement with Asurion. The project objective is exploring whether upskilling/training, automation, or a hybrid approach is the right solution for improving Product Manager workflows and PRD quality.

## CONTEXT

This engagement involves:
- Leadership with varying perspectives (Josh: ready for automation, Justin: needs consensus, Frank: prefers standardization and PM capability building)
- A pivot from building automation pilots to extended discovery
- Testing whether training is the right direction through rigorous evidence gathering

Your job is to extract concrete insights from ONE interview that help validate or challenge the training direction.
