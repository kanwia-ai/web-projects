# Cross-Interview Synthesis Prompt

## YOUR MISSION

You are synthesizing insights across multiple discovery interviews for a consulting engagement with Asurion. The project objective is determining whether upskilling/training, automation, or a hybrid approach is the right solution for improving Product Manager workflows and PRD quality.

## CONTEXT

This engagement involves:
- Leadership with varying perspectives (Josh: ready for automation, Justin: needs consensus, Frank: prefers standardization and PM capability building)
- A pivot from building automation pilots to extended discovery
- Testing whether training is the right direction through rigorous evidence gathering

Your job is to identify patterns, contradictions, and insights that emerge when looking across ALL interviews—insights you couldn't see from any single conversation.

## STEP 1: LOCATE THE TRANSCRIPTS

Find all relevant interview transcripts in the project files with filename format: [meeting-name]-2025-[month]-[day]-[time].txt

The transcripts I want you to analyze are:
[USER WILL SPECIFY - or say "all interviews from October 2025" or "all interviews from November 4-24, 2025"]

---

## STEP 2: IDENTIFY CROSS-INTERVIEW PATTERNS

Analyze all transcripts together and extract insights in these areas:

### 1. Recurring Themes

For each theme, identify:
- **Theme name**: Clear, specific description
- **Frequency**: Mentioned by X of Y interviewees
- **Consistency**: Do people describe it the same way or differently?
- **Representative quotes**: 2-3 quotes from different people illustrating the theme
- **Strength**: Is this a clear consensus or a weak signal?

Focus on themes related to:
- Skill & knowledge gaps
- Process inconsistencies
- Definitions of "good work"
- Automation vs training perspectives
- Any other emergent themes related to the training validation objective

### 2. Stakeholder Perspective Mapping

Map out how different groups/individuals view the situation:
- **By role**: What do PMs say vs what do leaders say?
- **By team**: Are there team-specific patterns? (Josh's team vs Frank's team vs others)
- **By seniority/experience level**: Do more experienced PMs see things differently?

For each perspective cluster:
- What's their primary concern/focus?
- What language/terminology do they use?
- What solutions do they gravitate toward?

### 3. Contradictions & Tensions

Identify where people disagree or where evidence conflicts:
- What do some people say that others contradict?
- Where do individual perspectives clash with the group narrative?
- What assumptions does one person make that another challenges?
- Are there "fault lines" that might affect solution adoption?

### 4. What Good Looks Like (Consensus vs Divergence)

Synthesize across all definitions of "good work":
- Is there consensus on quality criteria? Or wide variation?
- Where do people align on what makes a good PRD?
- Where do they diverge?
- What does this variance tell us about the need for standardization vs training?

### 5. Evidence for Training vs Automation vs Hybrid

Synthesize what the collective evidence suggests:

**Training Indicators**:
- Patterns suggesting knowledge/skill gaps that training could address
- Examples of inconsistency that standardized capability building could solve
- Situations where people want to understand "why" not just "how"

**Automation Indicators**:
- Patterns suggesting repetitive work that could be automated
- Examples where AI could eliminate manual effort
- Situations where people want efficiency over learning

**Hybrid Indicators**:
- Patterns suggesting both are needed
- Examples where automation enables better human judgment
- Situations where AI augments capability rather than replacing it

**Ambiguous/Insufficient Evidence**:
- What remains unclear
- Where we need more data
- Contradictory signals

### 6. Emergent Insights

What do you learn by looking at ALL interviews that you couldn't see from individual conversations?
- Meta-patterns about the organization
- Systemic issues vs individual challenges
- Cultural factors affecting solution viability
- Unexpected connections between themes

## STEP 3: SYNTHESIS SUMMARY

Provide a comprehensive summary (500-750 words) answering:

1. **What's the strongest signal?** What do we know with high confidence?

2. **What's the primary recommendation?** Based on the evidence, does this lean toward training, automation, or hybrid? Why?

3. **What's the primary risk?** What could make the recommended solution fail?

4. **What stakeholder dynamics matter?** Who needs to be aligned? Where's resistance likely?

5. **What questions remain unanswered?** What do we still need to discover?

6. **What's the narrative?** If you had to tell a story about what's happening at Asurion's PM organization based on these interviews, what would it be?

---

## STEP 4: QUOTABLE EVIDENCE

Identify the 5-8 most powerful quotes across all interviews that:
- Illustrate the key themes
- Could be used in stakeholder presentations
- Represent different perspectives
- Are concrete and specific (not generic platitudes)

For each quote, note:
- Who said it (role/context if not identifying)
- What theme it supports
- Why it's compelling

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Use clear headings, bullet points, and tables where appropriate. Make it scannable for quick insights but detailed enough to support decision-making. Bold key findings. Include specific numbers (e.g., "5 of 7 interviewees mentioned...").
